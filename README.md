OOPS stand for - "Object Oriented Programming System". It is used to reusability and security of the code.

OOPS provide main 4 pillers.

       e. Heririchal Inheritance
3. Polymorphism - Polymorphism is same heririchal tree like structure. May have with the same name but different behaviour. There is total 2 types of polymorphism...
       a. Compiletime Polymorphism
       b. Runtime Polymorphism
5. Abstraction - Abstarction is a process to hiding the unnecessary data and showing only the necessary data to the user. We acieve abstraction by using two ways.
       a. By using Abstract class.
       b. By using Interface class.
7. Encapsulation - Encapsulation is a process of wrapping the data and code into a single unit are called as encapsulation.
